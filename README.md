👋 Hello GitHub community! I'm a devoted father of two amazing children, originally from the United States. Currently, my family and I call the picturesque country of Poland our home.

💻 I specialize in iOS app development using SwiftUI and Swift, crafting intuitive and elegant applications. Additionally, I am proficient in Angular for web development and Python for versatile scripting and backend tasks. Alongside my talented wife, we navigate the challenges and joys of parenthood while immersing ourselves in the diverse cultural landscape of Poland.

🏡 In addition to my roles as a parent and a developer, I'm an active member of the local community, seeking connections and fostering understanding across different backgrounds. Living in Poland has expanded our worldview and provided unique opportunities for cultural exploration.

🌟 Each day brings new discoveries, challenges, and moments of joy, contributing to a meaningful and fulfilling life in this international setting.

🔍 Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories, where I bring a global perspective to my coding adventures. Excited to connect with fellow developers and share experiences from this unique chapter of life! 🚀
