👋 Hello GitHub community! 

💻 I specialize in iOS, macOS app development using SwiftUI and Swift, crafting intuitive and elegant applications. Additionally, I am proficient in Angular for web development and Python for versatile scripting and backend tasks. Alongside my talented wife, we navigate the challenges and joys of parenthood.

🏡 In addition to my roles as a parent and a developer, I'm an active member of the local community, seeking connections and fostering understanding across different backgrounds. 

🌟 Each day brings new discoveries, challenges, and moments of joy, contributing to a meaningful and fulfilling life in this international setting.

🔍 Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories, where I bring a global perspective to my coding adventures. Excited to connect with fellow developers and share experiences from this unique chapter of life! 🚀
